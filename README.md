# coin-flip.gb

This was a simple gameboy coin flip rom I made while watching [geiser](https://twitch.tv/imgeiser). I made it because it was a random project at *I forgot what time.*  

**Compiled builds are in the build folder.**  

This rom was made using [GB Studio](https://gbstudio.dev)  
Sprites were made using [aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org)
